# CPACS

CPACS stands for compressor performance analysis and control support. CPACS is designed as a desktop engineering tool for process control engineers to facilitate the understanding, visualization, validation, and anti-surge control design for centrifugal compressors.

The basic version of this software tool is a companion to the 2024 book "Process Control for Pumps and Compressors" by the same author of the software, published by Springer. Click https://github.com/NiuControl/CPACS/releases/tag/v0.2.1 for the files.
